# "Stellar symphony"
## A Computergrafik KÃ¼rteil project

Wintersemester 2024/25
Lecturer: Prof. Dr. Thomas Jung

This project is under authorship of Michael Kaup, s0589545

The scene represents a theaterroom in which the spectator sits, looking at closed theatre curtains.
Inside the room, a curtain rope hangs from the ceiling with which the spectator can interact by pulling it down.
If the spectator pulls the rope far enough, the curtains start opening and a spotlight is activated.
The curtain reveals a white canvas on which a spinning portal becomes visible.

The camera starts to move towards the portal and eventually passes through it.
Suddenly, the spectator fidn itself in space, looking at a floating stage with three instruments on it.
A text displays how to navigate around, how to use the GUI Buttons in the upper right corner, and how to interact with the instruments.

Via the Buttons, music can be started, suspended or stopped.
After the tutorial has been showen once, buttons are added to the gui to bring back the tutorial for certain parts of the scene, if needed.
